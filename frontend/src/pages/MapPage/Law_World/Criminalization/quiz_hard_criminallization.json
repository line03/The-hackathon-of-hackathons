      "question": "A high-ranking cabinet minister in a State Party is accused of embezzling public funds. The minister's legal team argues that their position grants them absolute jurisdictional immunity from prosecution for any acts performed while in office. According to Article 30 of the Convention, how must the State Party's legal system address this claim?",
      "answerOptions": [

          "text": "The State Party's legal system must uphold the principle that jurisdictional privileges automatically suspend the possibility of investigation until the official leaves office.",

          "text": "The State Party must establish or maintain an appropriate balance between any immunities accorded to public officials and the possibility of effectively investigating, prosecuting, and adjudicating such offenses.",

          "text": "The Convention mandates the immediate removal of the public official from their position upon accusation, thereby nullifying any claims to immunity.",
          "rationale": "Article 30, paragraph 6, suggests removal or suspension as a possibility to consider, bearing in mind the presumption of innocence, but it is not a mandatory first step to overcome immunity.",

      "question": "An investigator is building a case against a shell corporation suspected of laundering proceeds from bribery. The defense argues that the prosecution has no direct evidence, such as a recorded confession or an email, proving the corporation's managers *knew* the funds were from an illicit source. How does Article 28 address this evidentiary challenge?",
      "answerOptions": [
        {
          "text": "It requires that intent must be proven through direct, non-circumstantial evidence to secure a conviction for laundering the proceeds of crime.",

      "question": "A businessperson is convicted of offering a bribe to a public official. The judge imposes a sanction that includes a very brief prison sentence and a minor fine, which is significantly less severe than sanctions for other financial crimes in that country. This decision raises concerns about compliance with the Convention. Which principle from Article 30 is most relevant to evaluating this sanction?",
